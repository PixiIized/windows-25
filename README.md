<h2 align='center'>What is it?</h2>
<p>Windows 25 is an in-browser recreation of Windows 95. It will have most of the features from Windows 95 and then some. In fact, it's essentially just a web-based OS.<br>
And the best part? It's easy to develop apps! You just need to code your app using plain html, css, and js, follow a few formatting rules and standards, and zip your folder before dropping it into the system!<br>
The name comes from the fact that the project was started in 2025, while Windows 95 came out in 1995.</p>

<h2 align='center'>How can I use it?</h2>
<p>Windows 25 is completely web-based, although I hope to make app versions in the future. All your information is stored locally as I don't have a server, but all data will be importable and exportable, so don't worry. You can use it on more than just one device.</p>

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 25 is not mobile compatible. It will not work on any devices that do not have some kind of mouse, such as smartphones or tablets.

<h2 align='center'>What features does it have?</h2>
<p>This project is not far enough into development for a features list. Try checking back another time.</p>

<h2 align='center'>How can I make apps?</h2>
<p>This is where I'd give you the basics and tell you to refer to the docs for more specific information, but as of now you can't make apps. Try checking back another time.</p>

<h2 align='center'>Screenshots</h2>
<p>This is where I'd have screenshots of the current version, if there were any. Try checking back another time.</p>
